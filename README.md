# Nepal_Banking_ML_Analysis Banking Branch Distribution & Financial Access in Nepal

This repository contains code, datasets, and results for analyzing banking branch distribution and financial access across Nepal using machine learning methods. The study combines branch-level data, demographic information, and local administrative features to identify underserved areas and provide insights for branch expansion and financial inclusion planning.

## Contents

- **Data:** Raw CSV files containing branch-level, household, and population data.  
- **Notebooks:** Cleaned Colab notebook implementing data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, K-Means clustering, and Random Forest classification.  
- **Output:** Figures and tables generated by the notebook. Includes distributions of branch counts, populations, PCA plots, cluster summaries, and model evaluation.

## Key Features

- Preprocessing of branch-level and demographic datasets.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with numeric summaries, histograms, boxplots, and top categorical counts.  
- K-Means clustering to group municipalities based on branch coverage and population characteristics.  
- Random Forest classification to predict dominant bank types in each municipality.  
- Outputs include CSV summaries and publication-ready figures.

## Usage

1. Upload the notebook to **Google Colab**.  
2. Place all CSV files in the `data/` folder.  
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially. All figures and tables will be saved automatically in the `output/` directory.
